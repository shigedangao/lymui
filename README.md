## Lymui 🌈
 
Lymui is a color library which allows you to convert an RGB color to an other color (see the supported list of colors below).

⚠️ I'm not a color expert. Most of the implementation formula's are based on articles that I founded on wikipedia, blog post but the colors conversion has been cross-checked with other websites and articles. But I'm open to any fixes if there are errors 😁
