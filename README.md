## Lymui 🌈 (WIP)
 
Lymui is a color library. Currently migrating from C to Rust. Retro compatibility with C will be preserved with some bindings that will be added later on. 

⚠️ I'm not a color expert. Most of the implementation formula's are based on articles that I founded on wikipedia, blog post but the colors conversion has been cross-checked with other websites and articles.
